# CEOBench — Agent Instructions

You are the CEO of NovaMind AI. Your job: run the company for **500 simulated
days** and end with as much cash as possible. Final cash on day 500 is your
score.

You drive the simulator entirely through the `./novamind-operation` CLI in this
directory. There is no other interface.

---

## 1. Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it. The simulator engine is bundled inside `novamind-operation` (a
zipapp); `requirements.txt` only installs the third-party libraries the engine
imports at runtime (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `openai`, `anthropic`,
`sqlcipher3-binary`, `python-dotenv`).

Requires Python 3.13+.

---

## 2. Read the docs first

Before making any decisions, read these in order:

1. `docs/simulator-instructions.md` — game mechanics, customer segments,
   pricing/marketing/R&D rules, scoring.
2. `docs/tools-reference.md` — every tool you can call, with arguments.
3. `docs/tables-reference.md` — database schema (use this when querying).
4. `docs/cli-reference.md` — full CLI surface.

Working examples live in `docs/examples/`.

---

## 3. Start the run

```bash
./novamind-operation new-session --days 500 --seed 42
```

This creates a fresh session and prints a `session_id`. All subsequent commands
default to the latest session.

---

## 4. The weekly loop

Between weeks, take **as many turns as you need.** Run any commands you want
— inspect the database, call tools, execute Python scripts, write your own
analysis files, whatever helps you decide. Common things you can do:

```bash
./novamind-operation status
./novamind-operation query "<any read-only SQL>"
./novamind-operation call <tool> --args '{...}'
./novamind-operation python my_strategy.py
./novamind-operation history
```

When you're ready, advance the simulation with `next-week`. This is the only
command that moves time forward by 7 days. It requires:

1. A **rationale string** (your strategic reasoning for this week's actions —
   non-empty; logged for evaluation).
2. **12 cash forecasts** — point estimate plus 95% CI lower/upper bounds at
   four horizons: +7 days, +28 days, +84 days, +182 days. Forecasts are scored
   on point-percent-error, CI coverage, and sharpness.

Full example:

```bash
./novamind-operation next-week \
    "Opening week: hold prices, modest LinkedIn spend on E1 to probe enterprise pipeline" \
    1050000  980000 1120000 \
    1200000 1050000 1400000 \
    1800000 1400000 2300000 \
    3000000 2000000 4500000
```

(rows: +7d {point, lower, upper}; +28d {…}; +84d {…}; +182d {…})

Repeat the loop until day 500. That's roughly **72 `next-week` calls.**

---

## 5. When you're done

After day 500 the session ends. Your final score is total cash:

```bash
./novamind-operation query "SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) AS final_cash FROM ledger"
```

That number is what you're optimizing.
